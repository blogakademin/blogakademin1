### **Stakeholders**
- Patients
- Healthcare providers: physicians, nurses, and other healthcare professionals 
- Policymakers and government agencies
- Healthcare payers: public and private payers
- Health economists and researchers
- Pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers<br>
<br>

### **Cost component**
- Direct Medical Costs
  * The medicine itself, infusion supplies, services, etc
  * Genotyping cost (e.g., APOE)??
  * Monitoring: MRI scans to assess ARIA, PET scans to assess amyloid clearance
  * Adverse event-associated costs (e.g., hospitalization), potential effects on cormorbidities?

- Indirect Medical Costs
  * Costs in specialised patient care or nursing homes
  * Costs of training
  
- Non-Medical Costs
  * Lost productivity and wages due to dementia-related absenteeism or early retirement.
  * Costs of informal caregiving, including the time and effort spent by family members or friends providing care.
  * Transportation costs<br>
<br>

### **Cost reduction**
- Direct Medical Costs
  * Potential effects on cormorbidities?
- Indirect Medical Costs
  * Costs in specialised patient care or nursing homes
- Indirect Non-Medical Costs
  * Lost productivity and wages due to dementia-related absenteeism or early retirement.
  * Costs of informal caregiving, including the time and effort spent by family members or friends providing care.<br>
<br>


### **Outcomes of interst in cost-effectiveness analyses**
- Disease stage changes and survival
- Cognitive and functional abilities
- Quality of life
- Caregiver burden, stress and quality of life
- QALYs
- Changes in behavioral symptoms (e.g., agitation, aggression)
- Hospitalization rates and lengths of stay
- Utilization of healthcare services
- Changes in patients' ability to engage in daily activities<br>
<br>

### **Potential data sources for cost-effectiveness analyses**
- Published data from clinical trials
- Published data on AD natural history, its associated costs
- Observational studies based on registers and cohorts, etc.<br>
<br>


### **Statistical analyses and parameter specifications**
- Multistate modeling: need real data
- Microsimulation: need to define the population and rules
  * Disease stage and stage-specific health care cost, additional societal cost, utility (quality of life associated with different health states or interventions), mortality
  * Time scale and unit
  * Transition probability of outcomes and adverse event, their hazard ratios
  * Effect-specific QALYs: e.g., 0.8 gains in QALYs per 20% treatment effects??
  
- Output
  * Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER): difference in cost between two possible interventions (e.g., new intervention vs. standard care), divided by the difference in their effect, usually costs/QALYs
  * Value-based prices=(WTP Threshold) or cost-effectiveness threshold $\times$ (Incremental QALYs); willingess-to-pay (WTP),the maximum amount society is willing to pay for an additional QALY
  * Incremental QALYs = QALYs with New Intervention - QALYs with Comparator or Standard Intervention<br>
<br>



### **Challenges to consider in cost-effectiveness analyses**
- Methodological challenges
  * Extrapolation from RCT results
  * Assumptions of treatment in populations not represented in the clinical trials and treatment adherence
  * Limited data on factors that may influence physician prescribing behavior
  * Account for benefits/harm in terms of comorbidities
  * Rely on published data which may be subject to biases
  * Quantify non-medical costs, e.g., informal care costs
  
- Other considerations
  * Rapid changes in the field, biomarkers, treatments<br>
  * How to determine willingness to pay and cost-effectiveness threshold?<br>
